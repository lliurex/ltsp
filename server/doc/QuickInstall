This document aims to describe the quickest way to get a ltsp server 
running on an existing ubuntu or kubuntu (xubuntu comes with a ltsp 
option in the installer, edubuntu even sets up ltsp in its default 
install).

You need to set up one static interface where you will attach the 
thin clients, install two packages and run one command.

Configure your spare interface for the thin clients to have the 
IP 192.168.67.1, then run command below:

sudo apt-get install ltsp-server-standalone openssh-server

Now create your Thin Client environment on the server by running:

sudo ltsp-build-client

After that, you will be able to boot your first thin client. 
Note that if you want to use another IP than the above, you need to 
edit the /etc/ltsp/dhcpd.conf file to match the IP values and 
restart the dhcp server.

If you change the IP data after you have done the initial setup, 
please run the command sudo ltsp-update-sshkeys to make the ssh 
server aware of the change.
