# This directory contains "S" and "K" scripts that are sourced before 
# and after a screen script is executed (respectively).
#
# This directory also contains "XS" and "XK" scripts which are sourced (in
# screen-x-common) by screen scripts that start an X server.
# 
# While for the most part a xorg.conf is no longer needed and most 
# functionality can be achieved with a combination of Xserver arguments, 
# XRANDR, and evdev/hal, there remain a few things that may need to be 
# forced, such as the video driver used (XSERVER) or the monitor sync 
# ranges.
#
# In order to provide a drop-in file-based system for custom hacks,
# we created a mechanism whereby a monitor, screen, device, or module 
# hack for Xorg can be introduced in a file as a function and registered with 
# the XS90-assembleXorgConf file for execution.
#
# An example would be XS75-myFunction:
# 
# screen_hacks="$screen_hacks myFunction"
#
# myFunction() {
#    echo "blah" 
# }
